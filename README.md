# ESPN-Scraper

This is just a down and dirty little perl program that I wrote to web scrape pitching stats from ESPN.com
It follows down multiple pages to pull all the major league pitchers and place their stats into a database.

For now it just prints the data to the standard out ... hobby in progress.
